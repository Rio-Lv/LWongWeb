Since there was alot of data to work with for this project. I create templates for each level of the projects tab. Project Types contained types with its own format, types contained projects with its own format.

The information is nested and the templates are automatically allocated based on how deep within the nest it sits. The IDs of each project or project group gives information on how to render it into the website.
